# cjlib
C library for reading/writing json format files

# PROJECT STALLED.
  - CURRENTLY WORKING PART: The library successfully parses any JSON file and store's it in the memory as a AVL BStree.
  - DEVELOPMENT PART: Restore the object to the string version, given the AVL BStree.
  - I'm stopping the development for now, i will implement the last part at some other time.
